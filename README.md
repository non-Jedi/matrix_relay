# Matrix Relay

matrix_relay is a [matrix](https://matrix.org) application service for bridging
together matrix rooms. This is obviously the most important of all possible
matrix application services. All sorts of utility.

The main purpose of this project is to shore up my own understanding of matrix
aplication service apis and to demonstrate utility of the
[gyr](https://github.com/non-Jedi/gyr) library upon which this project is built.

## Status

matrix_relay is still under active development.
